This is a sequel to the previous blog where we had discussed about online postgraduate courses in the field of Cybersecurity. In this blog we are trying to go bit deep into this specialized field. Digital forensics also called as Computer Forensics or Cyber Forensics, is an emerging field especially in the government sector with special requirement in law enforcement agencies (LEAs). Here we have tried to list all the available online master's degree programmes available in the field of Digital Forensics. These are not in the order of rating or content quality, so peruse and choose your course.
