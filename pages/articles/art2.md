While it is recommended to study on-campus due to various professional and personal problems we can not pursue higher studies on-campus in reputed universities. Next best option is getting admission into online degree programs which are flexible, affordable and relaxed in terms of number of hours per week/month. It helps us to continue in our job and does not affect our family life. Best part on online courses are it give equal opportunity to learners across the globe to excel in their field of interest. Efforts are made to compile a list of different Masters' Degree Programs in 'Cybersecurity' offered by different universities of different countries. More focus was given on postgraduate courses offered by reputed universities of  Europe and USA. Approximate cost of Masters Program in Europe ranges from 8000 € to 29000 € and while that in USA ranges from 10000 $ to 50000 $.
